List of enhancements to be done in the next release

# Introduction #

I am planning the next release of Jc-Tree and looking for feedback on the current offerings and new additions. I have planned a few additions and am prepared to alter or add more to them


# Details #

  * Linked tree: a more conventional approach to building tree using parent and children nodes
  * SortedChildrenTree? : This tree keeps the children sorted
  * Addition of subtree(E e) and commonAncestor(E... e) as mentioned in [Issue 2](http://code.google.com/p/jc-tree/issues/detail?id=2) method in Tree interface
  * More tree implementations like Red-black trees, 2-4 tree etc.

If you have been facing any difficulties using the API or feel it could be a lot richer, please feel free to give your feedback
